##**Module 1 Challenge**
<br>
>Challenges in this Course <br>
>Challenge Types

>There are two types of Challenges in this course. Each one is designed to prepare you for a scenario that you're likely to encounter as a web developer.

>The two types of Challenges are the following:

>>1)On-the-job ticket or feature request Challenges give you starter code, which you'll modify to complete the Challenge.

>>2)Coding Challenges don't provide starter code. You'll build these from scratch.

>Challenge Elements
>Challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use agile project management to manage their work. Practicing this will prepare you for the workflows you'll experience as a professional full-stack web developer.

>***DEEP DIVE*** <br>
>Each Challenge contains the following elements:

>**User Story**: <sub>This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. This follows an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. For example, "AS A shopper visiting an online store, I WANT to place items in a shopping cart, SO THAT I can purchase them."</sub>

>**Acceptance Criteria**: <sub>These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In this case, we'll use a common format called scenario-oriented criteria which expresses each requirement in a WHEN / THEN format. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense now; it will become very familiar to you after you complete a couple of challenges.</sub>

>**Mock-up**: <sub>This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.</sub>

>**Submission**: <sub>You'll submit your completed Challenge for review. In the real world, when a developer finishes working on a project, another developer reviews the code, providing feedback on errors and making sure that all of the acceptance criteria have been met. For each Challenge, your instructional staff will serve as your team of reviewers.</sub>

>HTML CSS Git Challenge: <br>
>Code Refactor <br>
>***NOTE*** <br>
>Be sure to review the Professional README GuideLinks to an external site. before you start working on this assignment.

>This week, your Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's Challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

>One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

>Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

>Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.

>***IMPORTANT*** <br>
>An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

>To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

>Are you ready to jump in? Here are this week's Challenge requirements:_

##**User Story**
AS A marketing agency <br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards <br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines <br>
<br>
Acceptance Criteria
Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

[X] Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code <br>
[ ] HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning <br>
[ ] Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes <br>
[ ] Heading attributes fall in sequential order <br>
[ ] Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title <br>

##**Resources**: <br>
-Semantic HTMLLinks to an external site. <br>
-Image alt attributesLinks to an external site. <br>

##**Mock-Up** <br>
-The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality: <br>
-The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page. <br>

##**NOTE** <br>
This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

##**Getting Started** <br>
-Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages: <br>
-Download your starter codeLinks to an external site. for this Challenge and unzip the zip file. <br>
-Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer. <br>
-Add the starter code to the new repo on your computer and work through the Challenge. <br>
-When you're ready to deploy, use the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository. <br>
-Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page. <br>
-On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the main branch as your source. <br>
-Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>. <br>
-You can also refer to this YouTube video on enabling GitHub PagesLinks to an external site. for more guidance. <br>

##**IMPORTANT** <br>
It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment. Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!

>***Grading Requirements***

>>**NOTE** <br>
>>You are allowed to miss up to three Challenge assignments and still earn your certificate. If you complete all Challenge assignments, your lowest three grades will be dropped. If you wish to skip this assignment, click Next, and move on to the next Module. <br>
>>Comments are disabled for graded submissions in BootCamp Spot. If you have questions about your feedback, please notify your instructional staff or the Student Success Manager. If you would like to resubmit your work for an improved grade, you can use the Resubmit Assignment button to upload new links. You may resubmit up to three times for a total of four submissions. <br>

>>**IMPORTANT** <br>
>>No matter how difficult the course becomes, you must always turn in original work. Plagiarism is not tolerated. If your instructional or support staff determine that you have plagiarized work, your Student Success Manager will determine the appropriate course of action based on university policy. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, a documented plagiarism discussion, an incomplete or failing grade assignment, or ineligibility for graduation. <br>
>>It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized. <br>
